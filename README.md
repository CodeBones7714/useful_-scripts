# useful_-scripts
My collection of scripts that I like to use in windows and linux

# Windows
When adding scripts to windows that you want to use on a regular basis from the cli or powershell, you have to you system path:

1. The local location where you cloned this repo
2. the location where you saved any of the scripts from this repo

# Linux
If you want any of these scripts to run automatically upon login, or when you start a new shell, you have to add them to the .profile for that user, or to the skel .profile for all new users.

#will add more detailed help when I have a minute or when I add more scripts.
